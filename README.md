# CPE-487-Space-Invaders

Your final submission should be a github repository of very similar format to the labs themselves with an opening README document with the expected components as follows:
A description of the expected behavior of the project, attachments needed (speaker module, VGA connector, etc.), related images/diagrams, etc.
The more detailed the better – you all know how much I love a good finite state machine and Boolean logic, so those could be some good ideas if appropriate for your system. If not, some kind of high level block diagram showing how different parts of your program connect together and/or showing how what you have created might fit into a more complete system could be appropriate instead.
A summary of the steps to get the project to work in Vivado and on the Nexys board
Images and/or videos of the project in action interspersed throughout to provide context
“Modifications”
If building on an existing lab or expansive starter code of some kind, describe your “modifications” – the changes made to that starter code to improve the code, create entirely new functionalities, etc. Please share any starter code used as well.
If you truly created your code/project from scratch, describe that in brief here.
Conclude with a summary of the process itself – who was responsible for what components (preferably also shown by each person contributing to the github repository!), the timeline of work completed, any difficulties encountered and how they were solved, etc.
